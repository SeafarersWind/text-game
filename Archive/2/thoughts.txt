Every fighter, whether AI- or Player-controlled, will construct a set of options.
Afterwards they will select an option, at which process AI- and Player-controlled fighters diverge.

How are options constructed by fighters? How are they stored?
Put them in stack or static

Abby runs against the skell.
It attacks, she steps out of the way.
It swings again, and she closes in and slashes its shoulder.
The skell's arm falls off and Abby dodges another attack.
The arm rattles as it tries to reach for Abby.
Abby lunges her sword at the skell's remaining shoulder, but the skell swings its arm the other way and it mauls into her side.
Abby stumbles and the skell grasps her arm.
Its crushing grip tightens as she struggles franticly.
She brings her sword down on the arm while a kick bludgeons into her stomach.
She falls back, winded, and the severed hand keeps its death grip on her arm as the other hand siezes her ankle.
She clambers to her feet and her eyes are scorched with dread and fury.
A second kick lands on her side, but she sustains her footing. Her captured ankle bleeds harder.
She whirls her sword at the skell and intercepts another kick.
Ribcage and spine split and fall onto legs. Abby crutches herself back up with her one free leg.
She raises her sword above herself. The legs violently kick in everry direction. She brings the sword down inside the skull. 
The skell's hands slide off her arm and roll off her ankle. She gets up. Her ankle and arm burn where the hands were.
A gaping exhale of rubble rests in the skull.
Abby limps away from the broken skell.
She collapses.
She tries to recover her wind.
