motion: changes the fighter's distance from their opponent.
range: distance from opponent from which the attack can connect.
speed: raises the ability to evade. lowers the opponent's ability to evade or parry. scales with a fighter's posture.
power: deals heavy damage to opponent's posture and health. lowers the opponent's ability to parry. usually costly on posture.
sharpness: the amount of damage the opponent takes when an attack connects. a fighter can be vulnerable to specific damage types (e.g. stabbing or slashing).


reflex: higher speed
might: powerful attacks cost less posture
fortitude: higher resistance to power
endurance: higher stamina

DISTANCE =  current distance  +  a.mMotion  +  d.mMotion
xRANGE   =  x.mRange
xSPEED   =  x.mSpeed  *  x.reflex  *  x.posture
xBLOCK   =  x.mBlock  *  x.posture
xPOWER   =  x.mPower
xSHARP   =  x.mSharpness

if DISTANCE is within aRANGE,
 aHIT  = aSPEED*1.5 - dSPEED + 1
 aPARRY = aBLOCK - dPOWER
else,
 HIT = 0
 PARRY = 0

if aHIT > dPARRY,
 dDAMAGE = aSHARP * (aHIT + aPOWER)/2
 dTOPPLE = aHIT * aPOWER*k
else,
 aTOPPLE = dPOWER
