This is the start of a text game that is written in NASM. The concept is a turn-based RPG that can run entirely in the command line with vivid, complex, but accessible combat mechanics, 

The current working project is an unwieldy prototype of a combat system.

There are some more developed versions in the Archive folder. Version "0" contains my inspiration for this project, which I made in 2017 when I was first learning Java. I updated this version to fix some bugs and make it smoother. Version "1" was written for Linux, and proceeding versions were written for Windows. The most developed version is "6 Huefvul Road", which showcases an explorable town with primitive interactions, and a travel segment with functional enemy encounters.
