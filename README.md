This is the start of a text game that is written in NASM. The idea is of a turn-based RPG with vivid combat mechanics that feel expressive and support a diversity of styles. There would also be a focus on characters, dialogue, and relationships, on environments, sights, sounds, and feelings, and on various skills such as cooking, foraging, mending, and pathfinding. I wanted the experience to have a tactile feeling to it.

I created the earliest version of this game in 2017 when I was learning Java as a simple expression of how much I had learned at that point. The concept was somewhat inspired by Miitopia, in which travel was portrayed by an extending line, in the middle of which encounters would occur, and journeys were broken up by rest areas. It was in late 2020 when I remembered this game and I wanted to explore the concept further.

This project has lived most of its life in conceptualization by now. The systems are still far from what I aspire for them, but they still hold deep interests in my heart. The project has been on hiatus in the interest of other projects.

The current version is a broken and unwieldy combat scenario where the player can control both combatants. There are a number of elements that influence the hit conditions and damage output, with no randomization involved. These elements are still primitive and obtuse.

Previous versions are in the Archive folder. Version "1" was written for Linux, and proceeding versions were written for Windows. The most developed version is probably "6 Huefvul Road", which features an explorable town and a travel segment with functional enemy encounters. Version "0" contains the latest Java version I wrote in 2017, which I updated in 2024 to be more functional. "play.bat" should run the game if Java is installed.
